Predicting the movement of the pendulum using recurrent neural networks  
First, simulate the movement of a pendulum like animation  
Second, convert animation to frames  
Third feature extraction using convolutional neural network  
Fourth, send the feature to the recurrent neural network  
Fifth, predict the next frames
